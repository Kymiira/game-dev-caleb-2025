V - VARIABLES
- a variable is something that you can assign a value to from anywhere (ex: x = 3, let document.getElementById('elementid') = 3, etc.)
- there are 3 ways to declare a variable
- 1. "let" (name) = (value, variable, etc.) - accessable in an enlosed block (if statements, etc.)
- 2. "const" (name) = (value, variable, etc.) - unchangable value, a "constant" value
- 3. "var" (name) = (value, variable, etc.) - malleable value, can be accessable anywhere, I.E a globalvar
     
I - IN/OUTPUT
- this covers two similar things (inputs and outputs)
- an input is used for user accessability, when you want the user to *input* something for the program to do something else with. they grab values or can run functions via events.
- an output is used to display something the program did with the values given to it, it can be used to display images, text, or other content.

D - DECISIONS
- a decision is used in code to tell the program to do something
- there are multiple ways to run decisions, but the most common are
- 1. "if" statements - ex: "if x = 3 { y = 0}"
  2. "if; else" statements - ex: "if Light = on {EnableLight()} else {disableLight()}
  3. 
E - EVENTS
