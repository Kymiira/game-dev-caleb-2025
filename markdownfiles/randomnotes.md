# this is going to be used for random cool things i found while toying around with programming

1. - you can use a '#' (fragment identifier) at the end of a link to specify that you want to look for and view a specific ID in your HTML webpage.
  (ex: [base website](https://kymiira.github.io/game-dev-caleb-2025/public/t1a05-forms-caleb.html) vs [fragment identifier involved](https://kymiira.github.io/game-dev-caleb-2025/public/t1a05-forms-caleb.html#acceptTerms)
  notice that the webpage opens with the accept terms button at the top, no margin between the top border and the button.
  this can be utilized in websites with multiple sections, by adding an id to the section tag, etc. it is a very powerful tool for linking
