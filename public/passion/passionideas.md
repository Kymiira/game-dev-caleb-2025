1. platformer utilizing phaser as a framework
 - utilize a main collision entity class
 - extend main to player, hazard, win condition class
 - maybe implement grapple hook?
 - extend main to grapplable entity
 - maybe add enemy class extended from grapplable entity, utilize grapple to "damage"?
 - basically, use this project to learn how to utilize various frameworks, as well as learn classes.
    How does this practice OOL/OOP?
     - staple of object oriented programming is utilizing classes and extending those classes to others
     - this teaches class usage, leading to extra knowledge on OOP
